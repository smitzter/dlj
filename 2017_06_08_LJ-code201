### github
Today we learned how to merge on github.

### functions
I am feeling frustrated, at no one in particular but mostly myself for being creative -to a fault I guess. I missed the part of the instruction that said to create yes or no questions but I liked my questions and I put a lot of work into them so I left them assuming I got docked down but I understood the concepts so keeping moving forward. But then today final realized why it was suppose to be that way and my functions are not really that useful. I would have written my code completely different if I would have known this. I am challenged by this course not intellectually but as an out of the box thinker. I am regretting my life choice right now but there is no turning back now so keep moving forward.

### pair programming
My brain does not function well doing this. I am not sure I am going to get any more functional.

### On Success:
I just finished watching the video. In college, amoung other things, I studied conflict resolution with a lens of transformative justice. My teacher taught this concept that if a person of privilege, say a white cis het man, does something good then it is attributed to his character. "Joe is a fine man with lots of merit."" If it is say a women of color then it is attributed to circumstances. "Jill was in the right place at the right time" or in our neoliberalism someone would probably say she got a promotion because of affirmative action or diversity quotas. The opposite is also true. If Joe does something bad, it is attributed to circumstances. For example, white male teenagers are just being teenagers. Black male teenagers are violent threats that need to be shot. In the latter, anything bad that happens is attributed to the Black male's character.

This same concept can be applied to most things in life including education. If someone is not succeeding in school then it is a failure of their merit. If someone has a disability, there is probably access issues that impact that person's ability to learn. If someone grew up in a disruptive household, there might be ADHD and other impacts of trauma. More info:[ACE](https://www.google.com/search?q=ACE+score&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8). There are multiple learning styles and some are considered disabilities (Autism). Physical disabilities, visible and invisible (Environmental Sensitivity and other autoimmunity diseases), can cause a ton of problems. Microagressions also impact learning. Not seeing yourself reflected in the student and faculty body.

Then there are also impacts such as length of commute, funds to pay for food to go and other time savers, support network of family (note that not only do nuclear families regularly disown Queer folks but also in our society it has been illegal for Queers to have their own legal family).Additionally, it is not considered the time that people with economic privilege have had their whole life to be more successful people, in addition to a positive support network. Economically dis-privileged individuals often grow up working instead of investing time in extracurricular hobbies and building relationships (Good ole boy club). I could go on but hopefully my point is made.    

We are total that we are equal but what does that actually mean. This illustration has always been a good visual for me to explain the difference I see between equality, equity and liberation.

Also on the note of failure and success, I am not sure they told you but our success in this program is driven by large monetary fines.</diatribe>
