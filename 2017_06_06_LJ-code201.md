#LJ Code 201 - 2017 06 06
##First project
Today we started our first project. We are building a web page in *HTML* that interfaces with some *CSS* and *JavaScript* that asks the user questions about ourselves like a game.

We also started these journals which are written in **markdown** which is like *HTML* but more basic.
