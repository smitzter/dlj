## journal entry 5

I am not really sure what to write about. I reviewed the material on images and videos. Last week we did a lot on formatting the page. We made a mock website called Salmon Cookies and a mock blog page for Chocolate Pizza. I have some catch up to do but feel ok about it as it is not material I do not understand but just work that I need to do. I am glad that this is the material we reviewed while I was gone as it is material I am familiar with. I am nervous about going to Microsoft tomorrow. I am exhausted.
