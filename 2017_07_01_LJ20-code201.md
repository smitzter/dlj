## journal entry 12 for Class 20

I am not sure what to write here. We had our presentations. It went fine. The graphics got changed enough that it was tolerable. I am mostly still processing the feelings about getting pulled into a requited emotional vulnerable situation hours before having to get up in front of people and present. It shook whatever fake confidence I had mustered. Right now I recognize I need to coat check my emotional feelings in order to move forward with this program. I am greatly disappointed that I will have little to no time for self-care over the break and recognize this means I am going to be coming into 301 stressed and burnt out. I also recognize that this means that I will have to be more constrained and more guarded. I am also irritated that I am going to have to spend some of that time educating someone about why their behaviors are problematic, for free.

At the conference, one of the items on the agenda was talking about an antiracism/anti-oppression training I have been working on for, well, let's just say a long time. The consensus was that individuals who are not already doing their work and studying anti-oppression can not be, er in short, coerced to the table. They need to come to the table by themselves and be doing the work to be there. I tend to agree with this. I tend to be a t a point in my life that I don't hold people's hands anymore. I don't try to get people to understand how their behaviors impact others. I am more likely to just say, how about you just leave me alone. This comes from years -years- of doing this work, holding people's hands, gently trying to help them see and understand their privilege. I cannot think of one person who this worked for. I can think of a lot of situations where I spend my time and energy on an individual, often for free, and with no return.

My lesson in all this is not how to get people to be my ally. I know how to find allies. My lesson in all this is how to not care and how to assert my needs around my disabilities.
