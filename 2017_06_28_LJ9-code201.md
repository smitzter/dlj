# LJ Code 201 - 2017 06 28
## journal entry 9

Today we continued to code. I drove most of the day. We started with some group coding by setting up the local storage for the journal page. Yesterday we busted out some basic html. I did the trails page which although did not have the radio buttons nor the form was tricky in placement of ids. In the afternoon we group coded out push elements to the trails page and getting the index.html form page to propagate the trails page. I like that we kept our mvps basic so we focused on making something that worked. Now we have Wednesday to make it pretty and push into some of those stretch goals.
