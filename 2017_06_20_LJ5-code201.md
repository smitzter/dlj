## journal entry 6

We are working on Bus Mall. We are suppose to have constructor functions. After struggling with my computer for a couple hours yesterday, I finally got to working on my code. I worked literal to wrap my brain around it but still was unsuccessful at coding the problem. I have no constructor functions.

I do not want to go to Microsoft today. I am really anxious about it and the whole program right now. More than struggling with the material I am struggling with the system. Two hours I sat bored watching my computer do its processes because I was required to be there until 5pm. This is inefficient use of my time. It is super frustrating. I feel like I am being punished for something (leaving early) which I have not been doing. We were told someone was kicked out but I can't figure out who. Trying to not focus on this but it is ike the elephant in the room now.
