### forms

I am actually excited about this part. I love data and user input is one part of data. I have made forms in html before and also admin databases so the javascript is the piece I am missing. And in case you have not read my assignment, still missing. I look forward to catching up on that.

###Inspiration

I am pretty exhausted. I also have a post it above the sink that says Always, forward, always and another that says simple keep moving forward. It is easy to get stuck in the trap of failure, as the video yesterday spoke to. At some point I realized this is resilience, to keep moving forward, despite mistakes or maybe even because of mistakes.

###Logic  
I have been most concerned about the logic portion, although I have always done well in logic based pedagogy, it was still a new methodology, a new way of thinking about problems. I am feeling more comfortable with this logic and feel like I am moving from being able to implement it to actually understanding the language(s).

###Belief
So in conclusion, I am going to focus on believing in myself and not let the anxiety monster nom away at my self-esteem.
