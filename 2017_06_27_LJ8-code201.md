# LJ Code 201 - 2017 06 27
## journal entry 8

I am struggling a bit with the current assignment and learning to be confident and take ownership of my work. Monday we moved on to doing wireframing and outlining our logic, basically advanced pseudo coding. What I lack in confidence I make for in creativity. I am trying to recognize that the concept of Chose your own hiking adventure was mine. That on Friday not only did I propose the idea but also had a good idea of how to set up the framework and how the logic would work. I also came up with the idea of having a journal to fulfill the requirements. It is nice to be working collaboratively as this is something I am experienced with.
