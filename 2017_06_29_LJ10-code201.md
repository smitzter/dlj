I figured out how to make an iframe element in javascript that displays an interactive google map on the page which was cool. I abandoned the project to take the trail specific image element and make it a background. I am looking forward to learning how to do this in JQuery though.

I am finding myself frustrated and it is probably mostly my fault. When I interviewed with Apprenti I was pretty clear that I did not want to do web design anymore because, like the Oatmeal comic, most of the time you have to navigate working with design nobbies who think that there color scheme based on puke and poop with fonts that basically look like arial design is like the best thing ever and any actual creativity or good design metrics are too much fun. My patience at explaining that design requires thoughtfulness of your user has waned to zero. Statements like "I like" and "I dislike" are irrelevant. And in general I am going to refer to someone who has been studying design for the last two decades and has professional experience working as a designer. But I am not everyone and my desire to puke at the design and color scheme is irrelevant to passing the class which is my main goal. People with privilege are great when you need them but quickly become a bane in the side when you happen to know more than them. I'm kind of like maybe we should have went for completely different designs for each page. I am just going to set it down and walk away. It meets mvp and that is all that matters. Keeping my eye on the prize. Ok so there is my rant. </rant>
